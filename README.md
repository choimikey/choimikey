<h2 align="left" font-weight="bold">About me</h2>  
<br><br>

Iâ€™m a developer who has passion for building clean web applications with intuitive functionality. I am addicted to the feeling of feeling accomplished. I fuel that feeling by solving problems. I enjoy of turning ideas into reality using creative solutions by taking into account time complexity. Innately, I am curious and interested in everything I come across that I do not understand at first. Therefore, learning new skills, tools, and concepts excite me. In addition to working on various solo full stack projects, I have worked with creative teams, which involves daily stand-ups and communications, source control, and project management.
